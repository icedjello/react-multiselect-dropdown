This version doesn't seem too promising.
It could work in principle but the `forwardRefs` & `imperativeHandles` might be massively over-complicating the problem.
Also, I've not had much luck in resolving the types here. I checked online and can't find an answer for how to type it either which suggests to me this is a silly solution and there must be a better way.
